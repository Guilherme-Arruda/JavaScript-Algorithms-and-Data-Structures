# Caesars Cipher

## 🎯 Objective

One of the simplest and most widely known _ciphers_ is a _Caesar cipher_, also known as a _shift cipher_. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the [ROT13](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-the-caesar-cipher-an-introduction-to-basic-encryption-3bf77b4e19f7/) cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus `A ↔ N`, `B ↔ O` and so on.

Write a function which takes a [ROT13](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-the-caesar-cipher-an-introduction-to-basic-encryption-3bf77b4e19f7/) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
